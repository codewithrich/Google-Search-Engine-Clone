## Introduction

The Google Search Replica web page is a project aimed at replicating the look and functionality of the Google search page. By passing search queries as query parameters in the URL, you can simulate making searches on Google directly from your own webpage. This project provides a simple client-side implementation to interact with the Google search engine.

Please note that this is a replica and not an actual connection to the Google search engine. The search results you receive are not from Google but are simulated within the web page.
