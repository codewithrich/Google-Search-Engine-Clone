## Introduction

The Google Search Replica web page is a project aimed at replicating the look and functionality of the Google search page.

This project provides a simple client-side implementation to interact with the Google search engine.

Please note that this is a replica and not an actual connection to the Google search engine. The search results you receive are not from Google but are simulated within the web page.
